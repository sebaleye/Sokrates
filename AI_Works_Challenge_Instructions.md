# AI Works Challenge START | The Anti-Portfolio in 48 Hours

**Start:** December 12, 2025, 4:00 PM CET  
**Deadline:** December 14, 2025, 4:00 PM CET

## THE CHALLENGE: THE ANTI-PORTFOLIO

### The Problem We're Solving

The traditional portfolio is obsolete. Lists of job titles, generic screenshots, identical CVs - they don't tell who you really are, how you think, why you're unique.

### Your Mission

Rethink the professional portfolio assuming AI has always existed. We're not looking for an AI "enhanced" CV, but a completely new format that:

- Values human uniqueness, not the job title
- Shows HOW you think and solve problems, not just WHAT you've done
- Tells your unique "professional fingerprint"
- Demonstrates concrete results with tangible proof
- Reveals your process and methodology, not just the final output

---

## WHAT YOU MUST DELIVER (3 DELIVERABLES)

### 1️⃣ PORTFOLIO GENERATOR TOOL

An AI-powered tool that generates personalized portfolios

**Input it must handle:**
- Professional information (CV, LinkedIn export, free text)
- Projects and past work (GitHub, Behance, case studies)
- Work philosophy and personal methodologies
- Interests, passions, what you love/hate about your work
- Failures and lessons learned

**Output it must produce:**
- Personalized and unique web portfolio for each person
- Format that breaks with traditional conventions
- Focus on "what I do better than anyone else"

**Delivery:** GitHub repository link + README with installation and usage instructions. The tool must WORK (not just a concept).

### 2️⃣ THREE EXAMPLE PORTFOLIOS

Demonstrate your tool's versatility with 3 different portfolios

Create portfolios for 3 different professional profiles (e.g., developer, designer, marketer) that show completely different styles and narratives.

**Accepted formats:** Web/HTML (ideal), Google Docs, Markdown

**Delivery:** Publicly accessible direct links

### 3️⃣ FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT

Explain your anti-portfolio philosophy

**Must contain:**
- **Base assumptions:** What makes a portfolio "anti-traditional"?
- **Patterns and questions:** What information do you collect and why?
- **Design principles:** How do you value uniqueness vs standardization?
- **Distinctive elements:** At least 5 characteristics that differentiate it (e.g., zero job titles, failures section, proprietary methodologies, real metrics, process beyond result)
- **AI-native vision:** How does it rethink the portfolio for a world where AI has always existed?

## SUGGESTED APPROACHES

### No-Code Speed Run
**Typeform + Zapier + LLM API + Notion**  
Perfect if you have little time. Conversational form → automation → AI generation → clean output.

### Full-Stack Build
**Next.js + LLM API + Vercel**  
For those who want total control. Complete web app with modern UI and immediate deployment.

### AI Orchestration
**Python + LangChain + Streamlit**  
Multiple AI agents analyzing different aspects. Output via Streamlit for quick UI.

**Remember:** Innovation of the concept counts more than technical complexity.

## THE RIGHT MINDSET

### Don't think about:
- ❌ "How can I use AI to improve a CV?"
- ❌ "Which AI tools can I integrate?"

### Think instead:
- ✅ "If AI had always existed, how would we show human value?"
- ✅ "What makes a person irreplaceable in an AI world?"
- ✅ "How to capture the essence of who I am, not just what I've done?"

---

## THE TIMER HAS STARTED

**You have 48 hours.**

Don't create a better portfolio.  
Create a format that shouldn't even be called a portfolio.

**Good luck!**
