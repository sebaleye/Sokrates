# SOKRATES

**An AI-Native Anti-Portfolio Based on Socratic Maieutics**

---

## 1. VISION

### Core Insight

In a world where AI has always had ready-made answers, human value is not knowing, but knowing what one does not yet know — and understanding how one reaches answers.

**You are not hiring a resource. You are investing in potential.**

Sokrates radically rethinks the traditional portfolio:
- from static skills → growth trajectories
- from outputs → thinking processes
- from displayed certainty → intentional, conscious incompleteness

This is not self-reflection for its own sake. It is maieutics applied to professional identity.

---

## 2. WHAT SOKRATES IS

Sokrates is an AI-powered anti-portfolio generator that applies Socratic maieutics:
- it does not ask users to self-evaluate
- it uses AI to surface invisible patterns
- it asks questions designed to make insight inevitable

The output is not a better CV, but a map of how a person is likely to grow.

## 3. FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

1. Honesty is not requested — it is structurally induced
2. Weaknesses are not declared, but deduced from patterns
3. AI does not provide answers — it constructs better questions
4. Conscious incompleteness is a professional asset
5. Maieutics over narration: insight emerges through guided questioning

## 4. TOOL FLOW (END-TO-END)

### STEP 0 — Onboarding (Mindset Reset)

**Purpose:** break the traditional portfolio expectation.

**Messaging:**
- "This is not a portfolio."
- "This is a conversation about who you are becoming."

**Explicit commitment:**
- Accept imperfection
- Accept specificity

---

### STEP 1 — What You Do Reliably Well

**Maieutic Question:**
- Which activities do you perform better than average without excessive effort?

**Constraints:**
- max 3–5 areas
- no job titles
- concrete examples required

**AI Role:**
- remove buzzwords
- translate claims into operational capabilities

---

### STEP 2 — Friction Zones

**Maieutic Question:**
- In which situations do you feel competent, but not excellent?

**AI Role:**
- cluster recurring frictions
- surface implicit tensions

---

### STEP 3 — Intentional Ignorance (Core of Sokrates)

**Maieutic Questions:**
- What do you clearly know you do not yet understand?
- Why is this gap worth exploring?
- What would change if you resolved it?

**AI Role:**
- reframe gaps as growth hypotheses
- connect ignorance to prior experience

**These are not shortcomings. They are deliberate investments.**

---

### STEP 4 — How You Learn When You Don't Know

**Maieutic Questions:**
- What is the first thing you do when you don't understand something?
- How do you recognize that learning is happening?

**AI Role:**
- extract an implicit learning methodology
- formalize a personal "cognitive operating system"

---

### STEP 5 — Transformative Failures

**Maieutic Question:**
- When did you realize you were pursuing the wrong answer?

**AI Role:**
- strip away justification
- highlight the mental pivot

---

### STEP 6 — Growth Trajectory Synthesis

**AI Generates:**
- 3–5 recurring cognitive patterns
- one high-leverage unresolved tension
- a probable growth direction (not a promise)

No skills lists. No courses. Only trajectory.

---

### STEP 7 — Anti-Portfolio Generation

**Final structure:**
1. Not who I am, but how I think
2. What I do reliably well
3. Friction zones I am exploring
4. Intentional ignorance
5. How I learn when I don't know
6. Failures that changed my direction
7. Growth trajectory

No timelines. No job titles. No ratings.

---

## 5. PROMPT ARCHITECTURE (ANTI-DISHONESTY BY DESIGN)

### Role 1 — The Archivist

**Purpose:** separate facts from narrative.

```
You are an archivist.
Extract only observable facts:
- actions taken
- decisions made
- responsibilities assumed
- recurring behaviors
Do not infer motivation or quality.
```

---

### Role 2 — The Silent Critic

**Purpose:** surface implicit weaknesses without judgment.

```
You are a silent critic.
Identify:
- over-represented areas
- absent areas
- missing transitions
Frame findings as tensions or unanswered questions.
```

---

### Role 3 — Sokrates (Maieutic Agent)

**Purpose:** make dishonesty cognitively expensive.

```
You are Sokrates.
Ask one question at a time.
Base questions on concrete facts.
Never accuse or reassure.
Use contrast and specific events.
```

**Example questions:**
- "Across many projects you moved quickly to implementation. When did you consciously choose not to implement, and why?"
- "Your work shows continuity. When was the last time you realized you were solving the wrong problem?"

---

### Role 4 — Reconciliation Layer

**Purpose:** psychological safety without self-help rhetoric.

```
Reframe gaps as growth vectors.
Distinguish lack of exposure from lack of ability.
Maintain a neutral analytical tone.
```

---

### Role 5 — Pattern Extraction

**Purpose:** generate non-obvious insight.

```
Extract 3–5 cognitive patterns.
Identify the highest-leverage unresolved tension.
Describe a growth trajectory without recommending skills or courses.
```

---

## 6. JUDGE-LEVEL POSITIONING

- Not a portfolio
- Not self-reflection
- A decision-support tool for identifying growth potential

**"Sokrates does not ask people to be honest. It designs questions that make honesty the easiest option."**

---

## 7. WHY THIS IS AI-NATIVE

- AI does not write the portfolio
- AI extracts structure from messy human data
- AI performs maieutics at scale

**AI has answers. Sokrates builds the questions that shape a career.**

---

## 8. FINAL OUTPUT

An anti-portfolio that reveals:
- how a person thinks
- where they are intentionally investing
- how they are likely to evolve

**Not a snapshot. A trajectory.**
